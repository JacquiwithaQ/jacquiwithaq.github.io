    <div class="subtitle">Research project exploring needs and expectations for hybrid virtual-physical homes.</div>
    <div class="description">There has been a great deal of research regarding the ways that people conceptualize and interact with places they call "home." This work has been extended to virtual reality primarily in the context of design tools. Here, we explore the idea of a hybrid virtual-physical home that uses virtual space to supplement an existing physical home. We identify variation in the spatial context of place attachment to homes. A user study (N = 25) revealed the expectations and needs these groups have for virtual home spaces, including security, familiarity, and community. We prototyped and playtested three virtual rooms, and identified design features that supported feelings of home. Finally, we present challenges to designing home-like VR environments that can shape future research in this area. As virtual reality grows increasingly accessible, these findings will inform the design of virtual spaces.</div><br>

    This research was done through CMU's <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu" class="text_link" target="_blank">Entertainment Technology Center</a>, and was funded by Verizon. I was part of a team of eight students working under Professors Lauren Herckis, Thomas W. Corbett, and Jessica Hammer. While the project was ongoing, I presented it in an REU poster session (view the poster <a href="data/vrhome_poster.pdf" class="text_link" target="_blank">here</a>). We also wrote a paper that was published under DIS 2020 and received an honorable mention award (top 5% of papers). The paper is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3357236.3395561" class="text_link" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/vrhome1.jpg">The meditation room. Our goal was to make a space in which users could feel comfortable. The rocks in the board are a diagetic interface that controls the volume of different sounds and the time of day. A candle in the scene serves as a focal point for meditators, and lights the scene when it's dark.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/vrhome2.jpg">In the Greenhouse, users can bury, weed, water, and otherwise tend to plants that grow slowly over many visits. They can exchange gifts with virtual neighbors, and harvest vegetables and flowers. We use Leap Motion to track their hands, so all of these interactions can be done without controllers.</div>

The Hearth is designed to look like a cozy living room during a snowstorm, with a fire burning in the fireplace. The virtual furniture lined up with physical furniture so that users could actually touch and sit on it. We were trying to create a virtual environment where people could trust their senses. As part of this, we added a space heater and scented candle to the room during playtests.</div>
