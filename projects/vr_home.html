    <div class="subtitle">Research project exploring needs and expectations for hybrid virtual-physical homes.</div>
    <div class="description">There has been a great deal of research regarding the ways that people conceptualize and interact with places they call "home." This work has been extended to virtual reality primarily in the context of design tools. Here, we explore the idea of a hybrid virtual-physical home that uses virtual space to supplement an existing physical home. We identify variation in the spatial context of place attachment to homes. A user study (N = 25) revealed the expectations and needs these groups have for virtual home spaces, including security, familiarity, and community. We prototyped and playtested three virtual rooms, and identified design features that supported feelings of home. Finally, we present challenges to designing home-like VR environments that can shape future research in this area. As virtual reality grows increasingly accessible, these findings will inform the design of virtual spaces.</div><br>

    This is a research project that explores the potential for a hybrid virtual-physical home that uses virtual reality to meet people's home-related needs. These include things like personalization, privacy, and comfort, which may be missing from certain kinds of residences. Over the summer, our team of eight students designed and built four prototype VR rooms for the HTC Vive using Unity 3D and Maya.<br><br> Each room was inspired by a few key aspects of ``home'' that we found in the literature and our own interviews. The Meditation Room was designed to be comfortable and facilitate the development of rituals. It overlooks an infinite ocean and includes a diagetic UI that lets users control the volume of sounds and the time of day.<br><br> The Greenhouse was our exploration of change over time and caretaking responsibilities. Using Leap Motion rather than traditional controllers, users can plant, tend to, and harvest vegetables and flowers over repeated visits. They also can exchange gifts with their ``neighbors,'' who we fabricated for our prototype.<br><br>The Hearth, includes two cozy armchairs in front of a fireplace. We aligned physical furniture with the virtual furniture so that users could trust their eyes and interact physically with their environment. We were interested in physical-virtual continuity and whether or not it increases comfort. <br><br> At the end of the summer, I presented a poster for this project in an REU poster session, which you can <a href="data/vrhome_poster.pdf" class="text_link" target="_blank">view here</a>. We also playtested our virtual rooms as part of a user study, and are currently writing a research paper about our results. This research was done through CMU's Human-Computer Interaction Institute and Entertainment Technology Center.

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/vrhome1.jpg">The first virtual room we created: the meditation room. Our goal was to make a space users could feel comfortable in. The rocks in the board can be used to control the volume of different sounds, and to adjust the time of day. I was the developer in charge of the time-of-day controls, and of lighting the scene in general. I added a candle to serve as a focal point for meditators, and to light the scene when it was dark.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/vrhome2.jpg">In the Greenhouse, users can bury, weed, water, and otherwise tend to plants that grow slowly over many visits. They can exchange gifts with virtual neighbors, and harvest vegetables and flowers. We use Leap Motion to track their hands, so all of these interactions can be done without controllers. I was in charge of interactions with the dirt, which included digging holes, filling holes, and watering. I also created the environment outside the greenhouse and designed the scene's lighting.</div>

The Hearth is designed to look like a cozy living room during a snowstorm, with a fire burning in the fireplace. The virtual furniture lined up with physical furniture so that users could actually touch and sit on it. We were trying to create a virtual environment where people could trust their senses. As part of this, we added a space heater and scented candle to the room during playtests.</div>
