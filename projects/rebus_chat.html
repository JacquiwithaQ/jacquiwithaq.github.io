    <div class="subtitle">A messaging app that translates all text into rebus puzzles (picture puns).</div>
    <div class="description">Rebus Chat is an Android messaging app made using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" class="text_link" target="_blank">Android Studio</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Firebase</a>. The critical part of the project is the rebus-ification algorithm, which basically does the following: convert the message into a series of phonemes using the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" class="text_link" target="_blank">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, check the bank of around 150 named icons, and use dynamic programming to find the sequence of icons and letters that best matches the phonemes of the message. I hand selected the icons in this app from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a>, trying to cover most common short words and word parts.</div><br>

    <div class="description">Rebus Chat was made for the course <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>, and you can read more about the design process and rebus-ification algorithm in <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/jaqaur/05/09/jaqaur-finalproject/" class="text_link" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</div>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/rebus_chat2.png">An example of rebus-ified messages: the first person said "On top of the world" and the other replied "but underneath the ocean." Since the app ignores breaks between words, "but undern..." because "button + d + urn..." in the final puzzle. The algorithm also allows for imperfect matches, as demonstrated by "world" turning into "well + d."</div>
