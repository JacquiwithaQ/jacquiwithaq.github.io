    <div class="description"><span class="bold">Astraea</span> was originally made for the class <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating.</div><br>

    <span class="description"><span class="bold">Pick Me Up</span> is a three-minute animated short that was my final project for the class ``Animation Art and Technology.'' It was made over nine weeks on a team with four other animators. We used Maya for all of the animation, and Premiere to edit the final video. Many things were done using simulations, like the squirrel's squishy body, the turtle's tears, the broken vase, the flower petals, the newspaper, and the snow. To learn more about the production of <span class="bold">Pick Me Up</span>, you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/269727049" class="text_link" target="_blank">watch our ``Making Of'' video</a>.<br><br> I was one of the two body animators on the project, so I did all of the keyframed animation (excluding facial expressions) for about half of the film. I also was in charge of researching and developing the technique we would later use to simulate footprints in the snow. We did this by making the surface of the snow a soft body, making other objects colliders for it, and changing some settings so the prints would last and look natural. <a href="https://vimeo.com/262870514" class="text_link" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video documenting my experimentation with this. The whole team put a lot of work into the details of this project, and I think it really paid off in the final film.</span>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup3.png">The model and rig for the squirrel character. His arm joints are on a ribbon, so they can stretch and twist. The whole rig was designed to be very stretchy for exaggerated motion.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup4.png">Indentations in the snow were created by making the snow's surface a soft body and making other objects colliders for it. But we needed to prevent the squirrel's toes from lifting and dragging the snow around, so we put invisible rounded shoes on him that collided with the snow instead.</div>
