    <div class="subtitle">An animated short film about two animal friends.</div>
    <div class="description">Pick Me Up is a three-minute animated short that was made over nine weeks on a team with four other animators. We used Maya for all of the animation, and Premiere to edit the final video. Many things were done using simulations, like the squirrel's squishy body, the turtle's tears, the broken vase, the flower petals, the newspaper, and the snow.</div><br>

    <div class="description">I was one of the two body animators on the project, so I did all of the keyframed animation (excluding facial expressions) for about half of the film. I also was in charge of researching and developing the technique we would later use to simulate footprints in the snow. We did this by making the surface of the snow a soft body, making other objects colliders for it, and changing some settings so the prints would last and look natural. <a href="https://vimeo.com/262870514" class="text_link" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video documenting my experimentation with this.</div>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup1.png">A still from the opening scene of Pick Me Up. Almost every shot included some type of simulation, like snow, paper, or flower petals. The squirrel himself was even made a soft body so he would look more natural.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup2.png">A still from the final scene of Pick Me Up. The fog and most of the lighting was in the scene itself, but the glow from the house's interior was added in post.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup3.png">The model and rig for the squirrel character. His arm joints are on a ribbon, so they can stretch and twist. The whole rig was designed to be very stretchy for exaggerated motion.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup4.png">Indentations in the snow were created by making the snow's surface a soft body and making other objects colliders for it. But we needed to prevent the squirrel's toes from lifting and dragging the snow around, so we put invisible rounded shoes on him that collided with the snow instead.</div>
