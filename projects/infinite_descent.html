<div class="title">Infinite Descent: A Theoretically Great Idea</div>
  <div class="details">2018 Â· LSTM</div>
    <div class="subtitle">A series of proofs generated by an LSTM trained on CS course content.</div>
    <div class="description"><span class="bold">Astraea</span> was originally made for the class <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating.</div><br>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/infinite_descent_primary.jpg">Infinite Descent as it was displayed at the final showcase. I enjoyed watching the many responses, especially from students who were familiar with the course.</div>
    <span class="description">I made <span class="bold">Infinite Descent</span> for a text-generation assignment in the class <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>. It was inspired by my experience as a teaching assistant for the course 15-251, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science</a>. Students in the course are fairly new to writing proofs and their assignments are often very difficult to interpret. I decided that this would be an ideal context for ML-generated sentences, because text produced by a neural network always looks good without actually making any sense, much like a bad student submission. <br><br>I trained an <a href="https://github.com/bapoczos/ArtML/tree/master/text-generation-LSTM" class="text_link" target="_blank">LSTM</a> network on all of the 15-251 course content I could find, including course notes, homework assignments, and practice problems. Then I had it generate a large amount of text. Half of these I transcribed by hand to resemble the proofs that students submit for homework and TAs must grade. The other half I formatted to resemble the course notes, which students study to learn the material. In both situations, the reader is highly motivated to understand what is written. I invite viewers of the piece to step into one of these roles, and experience the frustration of not being able to fully comprehend the text in front of them. <span class="bold">Infinite Descent</span> was selected to be in the ``Art and Machine Learning'' final showcase, where students, TAs, and professors alike enjoyed trying to read the proofs and make sense of them. You can view the generated pages for youself below.</span>
<!--I have enjoyed watching the responses to <span class="bold">Infinite Descent</span>. Initially, I sent the "student proofs" without context to a number of my fellow TAs, and many of them offered grading suggestions or expressed sympathy that I had to grade such a confusing paper.-->

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/infinite_descent1.jpg">A generated page of "student proofs." I transcribed the text as quickly as possible so it would resemble the bad handwriting we sometimes get on assignments. Whenever I made an error, I crossed it out and continued, so the page would look messier and less organized.</div>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/infinite_descent4.jpg">A generated page of "course notes." Any generated paragraph beginning with "Definition" or "Exercise" went into this category, as did the one chapter heading that the network generated. At first glance, it is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.</div>

Any generated paragraph beginning with "Definition" or "Exercise" went into this category. Near the bottom, you can see it indicate that something is a GROUP problem. This is the network imitating a homework assignment.</div>
