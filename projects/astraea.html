    <div class="subtitle">A Daydream VR app for drawing new constellations with real stars.</div>
    <div class="description">Astraea is a mobile virtual reality application where the user sits in an open clearing, using a green stargazing laser to interact with the stars above them. When you hover over a star, it swells and displays its name. When you click on two stars in a row, a line is drawn connecting them. You can also rotate the night sky to any position you want. In this way, Astraea is not just a tool for drawing pictures but for learning about the night sky in an interactive way.</div><br>

    <div class="description">Astraea was made for the course <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The stars are populated from <a href="http://www.astronexus.com/hyg" class="text_link" target="_blank">The HYG Database</a>.</div>
