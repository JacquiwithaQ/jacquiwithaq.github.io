    <div class="subtitle">A puzzle game based around an uncooperative drawing tool.</div>
    <div class="description">Doodle Bugs is a web-based puzzle game, playable at <a href="http://www.doodlebugs.art" class="text_link" target="_blank">www.doodlebugs.art</a>. The central feature is a drawing tool with ten colors, each of which has its own "bug" that users must discover. For example, green strokes gradually erase themselves the more you draw, and purple strokes fall to the bottom of the canvas as if affected by gravity. The game presents a series of images that users must draw, accounting for and making use of the tool's "bugs." Their drawings are auto-graded and accepted if they are close enough to the goal image and don't use too many strokes.</div><br><br>

    <div class="description">Doodle Bugs is an extension of a puzzle called "Stroke of Genius" that was featured in <a href="https://puzzlehunt.club.cc.cmu.edu/hunt/13/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Puzzle Hunt CMU's S20 hunt</a>. I co-wrote "Stroke of Genius" with  <a href="http://tomwildenhain.com" class="text_link" target="_blank">Tom Wildenhain</a>. The mechanic was inspired by <a href="https://benfry.com/fugpaint/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Ben Fry's fugpaint</a>.</div>

    <div class="subtitle">A grid of 100 recorded attempts to solve a level of Doodle Bugs.</div>
    <div class="description">Sketch Garden is a typology project related to Doodle Bugs. When the game was featured in the CMU puzzle hunt as "Stroke of Genius," over 500 participants played it. I recorded everyone's keystrokes, and arranged 100 attempts at the flower level into a grid organized by general strategy. This format of displaying many drawings in a grid was inspired in part by <a href="http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/thesheepmarket/" class="text_link" target="_blank"> Aaron Koblin’s Sheep Market</a>. This project was made for the course <a href="https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-461/s2020/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Experimental Capture</a>, and you can read more about it in <a href="https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-461/s2020/jfashimpandrew-cmu-edu/04/30/sketch-garden/" class="text_link" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</div><br><br>
