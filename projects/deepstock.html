    <div class="description">DeepStock, also called "Deep Pix2Stock Salad," is a series of generative stock photos of salads, exploring issues of originality and ownership in online content creation. We began with a dataset of 2134 watermarked images of salads from <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search?search_source=base_landing_page&language=en&searchterm=salad&image_type=all" class="text_link" target="_blank">Shutterstock</a>. We trained an existing <a href="https://github.com/bapoczos/ArtML/tree/master/DCGAN_Pytorch" class="text_link" target="_blank"> Pytorch representation of DCGAN</a> on our dataset for 100 epochs (a timelapse of its progress is shown below). To improve the resolution of the resulting images, we created a <a href="https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Pix2Pix</a> model and trained it for 20 epochs where the A images were low-res versions of the pictures in our dataset, and their corresponding B images were the high-res versions. Then we used this model to sharpen and texturize our generated salad photos. The final photos (some shown below) had much more clearly defined bowls, leaves, and watermarks.</div><br>

    DeepStock was made as part of a group project for the course <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>. I was in charge of generating salad photos with the method described above (the project also included other generation techniques). Our full documentation is available <a href="data/pix2salad.pdf" class="text_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/deep_stock3.png">Late training results from the Pix2Pix texturizer. The top row is the input images (low res), the second row is the ground truth (high res), and the third row is the pictures generated by the network. The salads are still distorted, but it has added detail to the images, creating an impression of higher resolution.</div>

Shapes like lettuce leaves and shrimp bodies have sharpened, as have the watermarks.</div>
