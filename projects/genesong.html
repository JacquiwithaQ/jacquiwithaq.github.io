    <div class="subtitle">A randomly generated songbook, performed by real musicians.</div>
    <div class="description">Genesong (a portmanteau of ``Genesis'' and ``Song'') was my submission for a <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/148" class="text_link" target="_blank">NaNoGenMo generative book assignment</a>. I wrote a program in Processing that generates a sixty-page songbook each time it is run. To generate a song, the program first chooses a key, chord progression, and rhyme scheme. Then each line in the song is generated independently using the appropriate chord as a guide. Finally, it assigns one syllable to each note in the song using RiTa's random word generator and a random syllable generator that I wrote, making sure that the song follows the specified rhyme scheme. This information is then arranged on the page in the form of piano music, along with a song title (pulled from the chorus' lyrics), guitar chords, and random adverbs to describe how the song should be played.</div>
	<div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/genesong2.jpg">An example of a song that was generated by Genesong. The first page contains the three verses, and the second page contains the chorus. In addition to notes, guitar chords are displayed above the staff. The lyrics, while rhyming, are complete gibberish.</div><br>
	<div class="description">Genesong creates more than just a physical book you can flip through; it creates actual music that you can play and hear. The songs aren't very sophisticated, but they leave room for performers to put their own human touch into the song. I worked with Cameron Sullenberger (arrangement, accompaniment, vocals) and Stephanie Goff (vocals) to record three of the songs from the book in different styles.</div>

    <div class="description">This work was supported in part by funding from the Carnegie Mellon University Frank-Ratchye Fund For Art @ the Frontier.  More details about the song generation process can be found in <a href="http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/jaqaur/10/27/jaqaur-book/" class="text_link"> my blog post about the project</a>.</div>

Rather than choose five random song titles from the book to go on the back, I wanted to pick my five favorites to represent the book.</div>
