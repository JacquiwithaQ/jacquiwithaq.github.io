The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating.</div><br>

    <span class="description">I've always loved puzzles. So when my <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a> class assigned a project about communication, I thought about how puzzles communicate a message in an obfuscated way. I considered making a messaging app for an encoding scheme like binary or morse code, but ultimately landed on rebus because it's more accessible and fun for people who aren't experienced with puzzles.<br><br>I created an Android messaging app called <span class="bold">Rebus Chat</span> using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" class="text_link" target="_blank">Android Studio</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Firebase</a>. The critical part of the project is the rebus-ification algorithm, which is explained in more detail in <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/jaqaur/05/09/jaqaur-finalproject/" class="text_link" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, but basically it does the following: convert the message into a series of phonemes using the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" class="text_link" target="_blank">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, check the bank of around 150 named icons, and use dynamic programming to find the sequence of icons and letters that best matches the phonemes of the message. I hand selected the icons in this app from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a>, trying to cover most common short words and word parts. I was impressed with how effectively the app was able to generate rebuses, and I am often surprised and delighted by the way it represents my messages. Even people who aren't familiar with rebuses can usually solve and appreciate the app's "puns." I plan to add to the icon bank, polish the interface, and release <span class="bold">Rebus Chat</span> as a Messenger extension.</span>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/rebus_chat2.png">An example of rebus-ified messages. The first person said "On top of the world" and the other replied "but underneath the ocean." Since the app ignores breaks between words, "but undern..." because "button + d + urn..." in the final puzzle. I think this makes it more fun! The algorithm also allows for imperfect matches, as demonstrated by "world" turning into "well + d."'</div>
