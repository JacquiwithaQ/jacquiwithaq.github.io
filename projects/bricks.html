    <div class="subtitle">A typology of Lego airplanes made with the same set of pieces.</div>
    <div class="description">15 Bricks is a partial typology of Lego airplanes that are built with the same 15 Legos. These were obtained by asking different CMU students to build an airplane using all of the pieces in a set I chose. I gave 20 people the same 15 Lego pieces and asked each of them to use all the pieces to build an airplane. With so little to work with, they had to reduce the shape of a plane to its most important features, and each person had a unique approach.</div><br>

    <span class="description">15 Bricks was made for the course <a href="https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-461/s2020/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Experimental Capture</a>. A set of volunteers provided the Lego airplane designs, and I modeled and animated them using <a href="https://www.mecabricks.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Mecabricks</a> and <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Blender</a>.
