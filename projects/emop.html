    <div class="description">EMOP is a VR installation imagining what a newly self-aware AI might dream of. It was made as a group project for the class <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>. We trained an autoencoder on a dataset of point clouds, half of which were my groupmate's (these were shaped like women in different poses), and half of which we got from <a href="https://www.shapenet.org/" class="text_link" target="_blank">ShapeNet</a> (these were shaped like computers and monitors). Once the autoencoder had formed a latent space for these shapes, we wanted to let people explore it in virtual reality. The final result was a virtual reality experience where the user can fly around over an infinite digital terrain. Point clouds shaped like women or computers are randomly spawned, and as the user approaches them, they morph through the latent space into a different shape.</div><br>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pointclouds2.jpg">An example interpolation through the latent space from computer monitor to human (she is doing a backbend in this point cloud). Many interpolations like this were pre-computed and loaded into the experience, so as not to use too much computational power while the VR was running.</div>
