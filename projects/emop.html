    <div class="description"><span class="bold">Astraea</span> was originally made for the class <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating.</div><br>

    <span class="description">This was a group project for the class <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>. My groupmates and I were very interested in generating 3D content, and since one of us already had a large dataset of point clouds, we decided to work with that. We trained an autoencoder on a dataset of point clouds, half of which were my groupmate's (these were shaped like women in different poses), and half of which we got from <a href="https://www.shapenet.org/" class="text_link" target="_blank">ShapeNet</a> (these were shaped like computers and monitors). Once the autoencoder had formed a latent space for these shapes, we wanted to let people explore it in virtual reality. The final result was a virtual reality experience where the user can fly around over an infinite digital terrain. Point clouds shaped like women or computers are randomly spawned, and as the user approaches them, they morph through the latent space into a different shape. <br><br> Our initial concept for this experience was that we were imagining what an AI might dream of as it became self-aware, blurring the line between human and machine. However, many visitors who tried it had their own interpretations: some saw it as a commentary on the objectification of women online, and one person called it ``a confused robot's sexual fantasy.'' It was great to see people interacting with and thinking about our project.</span>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pointclouds2.jpg">An example interpolation through the latent space from computer monitor to human (she is doing a backbend in this point cloud). Many interpolations like this were pre-computed and loaded into the experience, so as not to use too much computational power while the VR was running.</div>
