    <div class="description">Tracing Movement is a computational art project where both the input and output are physical. I began by using a Kinect to record motion capture data of various actions, including ballet, martial arts, and gymnastics. Then, I put each action's data into a Processing program I wrote to convert the action into real-time instructions for an AxiDraw robot, which was fitted with a paintbrush instead of a pen. The robot would ``draw'' a dot in the location of a certain paint tray. Then, it would use the x and y coordinates of a particular joint over time to determine where to move its brush on the paper. Finally, it would dip the brush in water and wipe it off on a paper towel. This was repeated in a different color for every joint that was to be painted (in my case, this was the wrists and ankles). This project was made for the course <a href="http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactivity and Computation</a>.</div><br>
