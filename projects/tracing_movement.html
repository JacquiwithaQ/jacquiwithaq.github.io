    <div class="description"><span class="bold">Astraea</span> was originally made for the class <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating.</div><br>

    <span class="description">For this project, I wanted both the input and the output to be physical. I began by using a Kinect to record motion capture data of various actions, including ballet, martial arts, and gymnastics. Then, I put each action's data into a Processing program I wrote to convert the action into real-time instructions for an AxiDraw robot, which was fitted with a paintbrush instead of a pen.<br><br>The robot would ``draw'' a dot in the location of a certain paint tray. Then, it would use the x and y coordinates of a particular joint over time to determine where to move its brush on the paper. Finally, it would dip the brush in water and wipe it off on a paper towel. This was repeated in a different color for every joint that was to be painted (in my case, this was the wrists and ankles).<br><br>I really enjoyed examining the final paintings and noticing details in the motion, or places where the Kinect appears to have lost track of the body part for a moment. Some of my favorite results are the of Pas de Chat paintings, a set of four paintings based on three different trials of the same dance move. I think it's fascinating to see what things are the same or different between them.
