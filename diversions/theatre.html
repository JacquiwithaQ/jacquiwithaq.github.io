    <span class="description"><span class="bold">Astraea</span> was originally made for the class <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating. I eventually landed on the idea of giving the user a set of points, and only allowing them to draw by connecting those points. In particular, I give people the stars (populated from <a href="http://www.astronexus.com/hyg" class="text_link" target="_blank">The HYG Database</a>) and let them draw their own constellations. I like this concept because, in Greek mythology, the gods would only put people and items in the stars as the highest honor. Now, people get to decide for themselves what is most significant and what stories they want the stars to tell.<br><br>The final product is named <span class="bold">Astraea</span> after the daughter of the Greek gods of dusk and dawn, who is depicted in Virgo. It is a mobile virtual reality application where the user sits in an open clearing, using a green stargazing laser to interact with the stars above them. When you hover over a star, it swells and displays its name. When you click on two stars in a row, a line is drawn connecting them. You can also rotate the night sky to any position you want. In this way, <span class="bold">Astraea</span> is not just a tool for drawing pictures but for learning about the night sky in an interactive way. Hopefully it will help people identify real stars and find their personal constellations the next time they are stargazing.</span>

The user is hovering over the star Sirius, so its name is displayed below it (oriented relative to the headset's position). It took a while to get the right look for the stars; they are sized relative to their brightness from Earth, but enlarged a bit so they are easier to click on. All the stars with magnitude greater than 6 (ie. quite dim) have been filtered out. I watched real stars twinkling to get the ``twinkle'' effect right, which was ultimately done by rapidly and randomly resizing the glowing ring around the central point.">

I think the fact that it's in VR helps make the whole drawing experience more wondrous and peaceful. It was also important to me that this was for mobile VR rather than a bulky headset like the Vive. I want people to be able to lie down in bed and draw their constellations like they're telling bedtime stories. You can't do that with a lot of the higher-end headsets.">

I find that the stars are very effective at constraining what one can draw--not any picture can go anywhere; you have to think carefully--while still allowing a lot of room for imagination.">
