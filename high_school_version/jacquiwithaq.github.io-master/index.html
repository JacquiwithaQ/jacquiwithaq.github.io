				<h3>Pica Centro</h3>
				<table width="100%" class="buffer"><tr><td width="50%">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pica Centro is a game that Jacqui learned at a math camp in middle school. She likes to play it with her sisters on road trips. Now you can play it right here!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is to guess the three digit number that I have selected (no digits repeat) in as few guesses as possible. When you guess, I will tell you how many Pica and how many Centro there are. A Pica is a digit in your guess that is present in my number, but not in the same place that you put it. A Centro is a digit in your guess that is present in my number <strong>and</strong> is in the same place that you put it. You have an unlimited amount of guesses, but you shouldn't need any more than seven. Good Luck! You can begin guessing to the right.
