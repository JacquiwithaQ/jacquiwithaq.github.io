    <div class="description">Rebus Chat is an Android messaging app that automatically translates every message into a rebus: a puzzle in which words are conveyed by combinations of pictures and letters. For example, the word "here" in a rebus might be represented by the letter H, a plus sign, and a picture of an ear. As the user types into Rebus Chat, their message is broken down into its phonemes (pronunciation sounds) and a dynamic programming algorithmm searches for the rebus that matches it best. This updates in real time as the user makes changes, until they are satisfied with their rebus message and send it to be deciphered by the recipient.</div><br>

    <div class="description">Rebus Chat was made for the course <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>, taught by Professor Golan Levin. Its word pronunciations are from the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" class="text_link" target="_blank">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a> and most icons are from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a>. You can read more about the design process and rebus-ification algorithm in <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/jaqaur/05/09/jaqaur-finalproject/" class="text_link" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</div>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/rebus_chat2.png">An example of rebus-ified messages: the first person said "On top of the world" and the other replied "but underneath the ocean." Since the app ignores breaks between words, "but undern..." because "button + d + urn..." in the final puzzle. The algorithm also allows for imperfect matches, as demonstrated by "world" turning into "well + d."</div>
