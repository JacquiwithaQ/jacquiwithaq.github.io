    <div class="description">DeepStock is a series of generative stock photos of salads, made to explore issues of originality and ownership in online content creation. To generate them, I trained an existing <a href="https://github.com/bapoczos/ArtML/tree/master/DCGAN_Pytorch" class="text_link" target="_blank"> Pytorch representation of DCGAN</a> on a dataset of <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search?search_source=base_landing_page&language=en&searchterm=salad&image_type=all" class="text_link" target="_blank">Shutterstock</a> photos labeled "salad." A timelapse of the images it generated while training is below. To improve the resolution of the resulting images, I created a <a href="https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Pix2Pix</a> model specifically to sharpen and texturize salad photos. The final photos had clearly defined bowls, leaves, and watermarks.</div><br>

    DeepStock was my part of a group project called "Deep Pix2Stock Salad," in which Angela Liang, Anirudh Mani, and I explored multiple methods of generating salad images. The project was made for the course <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>, taught by Professors Eunsu Kang and Barnabas Poczos. Our full documentation is available <a href="data/pix2salad.pdf" class="text_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><br><br>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/deep_stock3.png">Late training results from the Pix2Pix texturizer. The top row is the input images (low res), the second row is the ground truth (high res), and the third row is the pictures generated by the network. The salads are still distorted, but it has added detail to the images, creating an impression of higher resolution.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/deep_stock4.png">A demonstration of the effectiveness of the Pix2Pix texturizer: on the left is an image that was generated by the DCGAN network, and on the right is that same image after it was transformed by the Pix2Pix network. Shapes like lettuce leaves and shrimp bodies have sharpened, as have the watermarks.</div>
