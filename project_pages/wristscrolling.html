    <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> Scrolling in extended reality (XR) is currently performed using handheld controllers or vision-based arm-in-front gestures, which have the limitations of encumbering the user’s hands or requiring a specific arm posture, respectively. To address these limitations, we investigate freehand, posture-independent scrolling driven by wrist deflection. We propose two novel techniques: Wrist Joystick, which uses rate control, and Wrist Drag, which uses position control. In an empirical study of a rapid item acquisition task and a casual browsing task, both Wrist Drag and Wrist Joystick performed on par with a comparable state-of-the-art technique on one of the two tasks. Further, using a relaxed arm-at-side posture, participants retained their arm-in-front performance for both wrist techniques. Finally, we analyze behavioral and ergonomic data to provide design insights for wrist deflection scrolling. Our results demonstrate that wrist deflection provides a promising method for performant scrolling controls while offering additional benefits over existing XR interaction techniques.</div><br>

    <div class="description">This research was conducted as part of my work with Meta's <a class="text_link" href="https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/" target="blank">Reality Labs</a> research team. I was the primary contributor to the prototypes, user study, and paper, with support from my colleagues <a class="text_link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nek5vXMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="blank">Amy Karlson</a>, <a class="text_link" href="https://tanyajonker.com/" target="blank">Tanya R.

Our paper published under CHI 2023 was entitled <span class="italic">Investigating Wrist Deflection Scrolling Techniques for Extended Reality</span>.

    <div class="square image_box"><img src="data/projects/wristscrolling1.png">In addition to comparing our two wrist deflection scrolling techniques with each other, we compared them each with an analogous state-of-the-art XR scrolling technique. This helped us see how wrist deflection input impacted user behavior within a particular control type.</div><br>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/wristscrolling2.png">(a) The user study apparatus consisted of a wristband with eight time-of-fight IR light modules pointed towards the hand, and two electrode fnger straps for the thumb and forefnger. (b) The study's Reciprocal Selection task involved scrolling back and forth between two targets as quickly as possible. Here it is shown with a 30 centimeter target size. (c) The study's Counting task involved counting the number of cats that appeared in a list of photos of animals (photos omitted here).
