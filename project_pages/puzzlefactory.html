    <div class="subtitle">The annual MIT puzzle hunt with digital puzzles, physical activities, and an interactive story.</div>
    <div class="description">The Puzzle Factory was the 2023 instance of the annual <a class="text_link" href="http://puzzles.mit.edu/" target="blank">MIT Mystery Hunt</a>, one of the oldest and most complex puzzle hunts in the world. Over 200 teams (3,000+ people) spent three days solving a series of advanced puzzles to progress through an interactive story. There were about 150 puzzles in a wide range of genres, including crosswords, logic puzzles, physical objects, online minigames, and in-person challenges on MIT's campus.</div><br>

    <div class="description">The hunt initially appeared to have a museum theme, but solvers were also given an "AI assistant" who had supposedly generated all of the museum's puzzles. This assistant was part of the true plot, which involved solvers going behind the scenes of Mystery Hunt itself and exploring The Puzzle Factory, where they would meet more AI characters and solve the unusual puzzles that they generated. Most of the hunt was accessed throught the <a class="text_link" href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/" target="blank">Puzzle Factory website</a>, which is still available in a static form.</div><br>

    <div class="description">The Puzzle Factory was created over one year by about seventy people from the group <a class="text_link" href="https://teammatehunt.com/" target="blank">teammate</a>. I served on the hunt's executive board as Creative Lead, which meant I managed the art and story teams (about eighteen total people). This involved making creative decisions about the plot, solver experience, and visual style, as well as tracking the work that needed to be done and coordinating with the tech and puzzle-editing teams. I also co-wrote twelve puzzles in the hunt, some of which are described below. If you want to solve one yourself without context, I recommend <a class="text_link" href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/puzzles/scicabulary" target="blank">Scicabulary</a>. A more detailed summary of the hunt's plot and some key puzzles are in the <a class="text_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/L0rwrNPqf2A?si=OEMydozpFKfbkUI-&t=3995" target="blank">wrap-up video</a>.</div><br>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/puzzlefactory4.gif">The "Hall of Innovation" is a set of puzzles in the museum-themed hunt that can be modified by gizmos in the Puzzle Factory. For example, the sliders set the maze's start and end points, the dials rotate the maze's walls, and the keyboard sets some of the letters in the maze. Completing this part of the hunt involved determining the correct gizmo settings to make all the museum puzzles solveable, and then combining those puzzle answers with answers to puzzles in the factory based on the factory layout.</div><br>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/puzzlefactory5.png">One of the physical challenges required solvers to collaborate on a series of art projects without seeing their teammates' work. In the "drawing" portion, each person was given a transparent sheet and a few colored markers with which to draw on it. They needed to communicate effectively with their team so that stacking their sheets at the end would result in a picture that fit the prompt.</div><br>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/puzzlefactory6.gif">In the "Wyrmhole" round, solvers could unlock progressively more zoom levels of puzzles that would contain the previous level's puzzles, until the whole structure eventually looped back around.</div><br>
