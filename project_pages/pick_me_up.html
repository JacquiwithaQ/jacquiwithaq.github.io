    <div class="description">Pick Me Up is a three-minute computer animated short film. It follows a squirrel as he learns that he shouldn't take his turtle friend for granted. Though most of the animation was manually keyframed, the film also features many simulations, like the squirrel's squishy body, the turtle's tears, a broken vase, flower petals, a newspaper, and snow.</div><br>

    <div class="description"> Pick Me Up was made for the course <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/cmu/courses/ART/60414/" class="text_link">Animation Art and Technology</a>, taught by Professors James Duesing and Jessica Hodgins. It was made over nine weeks by a team of five animators. We used <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview" class="text_link">Maya</a> for all of the animation, and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" class="text_link">Premiere</a> to edit the final video. I was one of two body animators on the project, so I did all of the keyframed animation (excluding facial expressions) for about half of the film. I also was in charge of researching and developing the technique we would later use to simulate footprints in the snow. <a href="https://vimeo.com/262870514" class="text_link" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video documenting my experimentation with this. You can see more of our process in the "Making Of" video below.</div>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup2.png">A still from the final scene of Pick Me Up. Almost every shot included some type of simulation, like snow, paper, or flower petals. The squirrel himself was even made a soft body so he would look more natural.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup3.png">The model and rig for the squirrel character. His arm joints are on a ribbon, so they can stretch and twist. The whole rig was designed to be very stretchy for exaggerated motion.</div>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pickmeup4.png">Indentations in the snow were created by making the snow's surface a soft body and making other objects colliders for it. But we needed to prevent the squirrel's toes from lifting and dragging the snow around, so we put invisible rounded shoes on him that collided with the snow instead.</div>
