    <div class="description"><span class="bold">Astraea</span> was originally made for the class <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>. The assignment was to make a tool for drawing, and I wanted to make something that would constrain what the artist was able to draw, but do so in a way that was meaningful rather than frustrating.</div><br>

    <span class="description"><span class="bold">Genesong</span> (a portmanteau of ``Genesis'' and ``Song'') was my submission for a <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/148" class="text_link" target="_blank">NaNoGenMo generative book assignment</a> in the class "Interactivity and Computation." I chose to generate sheet music over other types of content because I've always been interested in music theory, and wanted to see how much of it I could incorporate. After researching various principles of music theory, I wrote a program in Processing that generates a sixty-page songbook each time it is run.<br><br>To generate a song, the program first chooses a key, chord progression, and rhyme scheme. Then each line in the song is generated independently using the appropriate chord as a guide. Finally, it assigns one syllable to each note in the song using RiTa's random word generator and a random syllable generator that I wrote, making sure that the song follows the specified rhyme scheme. This information is then arranged on the page in the form of piano music, along with a song title (pulled from the chorus' lyrics), guitar chords, and random adverbs to describe how the song should be played. More details about this process can be found in <a href="http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/jaqaur/10/27/jaqaur-book/" class="text_link"> my blog post about the project</a>. <br><br>One thing I like about <span class="bold">Genesong</span> is that it creates more than just a physical book you can flip through; it creates actual music that you can play and hear. However, in its current state the songs aren't very sophisticated and the lyrics have no meaning. I would like to revisit this idea in the future, and perhaps use machine learning to generate the notes and lyrics. You can find the code for <span class="bold">Genesong</span>, and some example PDFs it generated, on <a href="https://github.com/JacquiwithaQ/Interactivity-and-Computation/tree/master/Song_Book" class="text_link" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</span><br><br>

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/genesong2.jpg">An example of a song that was generated by Genesong. The first page contains the three verses, and the second page contains the chorus. In addition to notes, guitar chords are displayed above the staff. The lyrics, while rhyming, are complete gibberish.</div>

Rather than choose five random song titles from the book to go on the back, I wanted to pick my five favorites to represent the book.</div>
