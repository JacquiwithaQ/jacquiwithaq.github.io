    <div class="subtitle">VR installation traversing a surreal landshape of changing point clouds.</div>
    <div class="description">EMOP is a VR installation imagining what a young neural net might dream of. We trained an autoencoder on a dataset of point clouds, half of which were shaped like women in various poses and half of which were shaped like computers and monitors. Once the autoencoder had formed a latent space for these shapes, we created a VR app to let people traverse it. The final result was a virtual reality experience where the user can fly around over an infinite digital terrain. Point clouds shaped like women or computers are randomly spawned, and as the user approaches them, they morph through the latent space into a different shape.</div><br>

    <div class="description">Evolving Methods of Perception was made in collaboration with <a href="https://tatyanade.github.io/portfolio//" class="text_link" target="_blank">Tatyana Mustakos</a>, <a href="http://charstiles.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Char Stiles</a>, and <a href="https://taitwayland.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Tait Wayland</a>. I was responsible for adding the point clouds to the virtual environment (using <a href="https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx" class="text_link" target="_blank">Keijiro Takahashi's PCX Plugin</a>) and making them interpolate based on the user's position. The computer-shaped point clouds came from <a href="https://www.shapenet.org/" class="text_link" target="_blank">ShapeNet</a>, and Char provided the human ones. The project was made for the course <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>, taught by Professors Eunsu Kang and Barnabas Poczos, and our documentation is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18w6n8OnOG3ObGJB2O1T14QqD7IyMTTj2/view" class="text_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><br>
