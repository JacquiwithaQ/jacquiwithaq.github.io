    <div class="subtitle">A Daydream VR app for drawing new constellations with real stars.</div>
    <div class="description">Astraea is a virtual reality stargazing app made for Google Daydream. It places the user in an open field beneath a starry sky, using a green laser pointer to interact with the stars above them. When they hover over a star, it swells and displays its name. When they click on a series of stars, a line is drawn connecting them. In this way, the user can draw anything they want in the sky, creating original constellations for their personal mythology.</div><br>

    <div class="description">Astraea was made for the course <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactive Art</a>, taught by professor Golan Levin. The stars' positions and magnitudes are populated from <a href="http://www.astronexus.com/hyg" class="text_link" target="_blank">The HYG Database</a>. You can read more about Astraea in <a href="http://golancourses.net/2019/jaqaur/03/06/jaqaur-drawingsoftware/" class="text_link" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</div>
