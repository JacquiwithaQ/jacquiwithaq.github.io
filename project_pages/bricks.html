    <div class="subtitle">A typology of Lego airplanes made with the same set of pieces.</div>
    <div class="description">15 Bricks is a series of 15-piece Lego airplane designs, presented as an animated video. These were obtained by asking 20 different CMU students to build an airplane using the same set of 15 Lego bricks. With so little to work with, they had to reduce the shape of a plane to its most important features, and each person had a unique approach.</div><br>

    <div class="description">15 Bricks was made for the course <a href="https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-461/s2020/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Experimental Capture</a>, taught by Professors Golan Levin and Nica Ross. A set of volunteers provided the Lego airplane designs and I modeled and animated them using <a href="https://www.mecabricks.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Mecabricks</a> and <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Blender</a>.
