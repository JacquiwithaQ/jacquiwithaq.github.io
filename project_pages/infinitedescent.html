    <div class="subtitle">A series of proofs generated by an LSTM trained on CS course content.</div>
    <div class="description">Infinite Descent was inspired by my experience as a teaching assistant for the course 15-251, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science</a>. I trained an <a href="https://github.com/bapoczos/ArtML/tree/master/text-generation-LSTM" class="text_link" target="_blank">LSTM</a> network on all of the 15-251 course content I could find, including course notes, homework assignments, and practice problems. Then I had it generate a large amount of text. Half of this I transcribed by hand to resemble the proofs that students submit for homework and TAs must grade. The other half I formatted to resemble the course notes that students study to learn the material. In both situations, the reader is highly motivated to understand what is written. I invite viewers of the piece to step into one of these roles, and experience the frustration of not being able to fully comprehend the text in front of them. Infinite Descent was made for the course <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artml2018/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Art and Machine Learning</a>, taught by Professors Eunsu Kang and Barnabas Poczos.

    <div class="tall image_box"><img src="data/projects/infinite_descent1.jpg">A generated page of "student proofs." I transcribed the text as quickly as possible so it would resemble the bad handwriting we sometimes get on assignments. Whenever I made an error, I crossed it out and continued, so the page would look messier and less organized.</div>

    <div class="tall image_box"><img src="data/projects/infinite_descent4.jpg" class="white">A generated page of "course notes." Any generated paragraph beginning with "Definition" or "Exercise" went into this category, as did the one chapter heading that the network generated.</div>
