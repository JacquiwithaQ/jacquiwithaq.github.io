    <div class="subtitle">Text entry method for AR/VR using comfortable thumb to fingertip pinches.</div>
    <div class="description">
    <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> PinchType is a new method of virtual text entry that combines users’ existing knowledge of the QWERTY keyboard layout with simple thumb and finger interactions. Users pinch with the thumb and fingertip to select from the same group of letters the finger would press on a QWERTY keyboard; a language model disambiguates. In a preliminary study with 14 participants, we investigated PinchType’s speed and accuracy on initial use, as well as its physical comfort relative to a midair keyboard. After entering 40 phrases, most people reported that PinchType was more comfortable than the midair keyboard. Most participants reached a mean speed of 12.54 WPM, or 20.07 WPM without the time spent correcting errors. This compares favorably to other thumb-to-finger virtual text entry methods.</div><br>

    <div class="description">PinchType was developed during my summer internship with <a class="text_link" href="https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/" target="blank">Facebook Reality Labs</a>. The idea was invented by my intern manager, Matt Longest, and I was the primary developer of the prototype. I also ran the user study and wrote the paper about the project, with help from Matt and our colleague Kenrick Kin. This paper was published under CHI 2020 LBW, and can be read <a class="text_link" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3334480.3382888" target="blank">here</a>.</div><br>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/pinchtype1.png">An example of the word "hand" being typed with PinchType. Four successive pinches are made, each corresponding to the group of letters that contain the letters in "hand" (a-d). Notice how the first letter changes as subsequent letters are added. Since the language model did not intially choose the intended word (e), the user has to disambiguate (f-g).</div>
