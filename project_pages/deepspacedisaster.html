        Matt and Emma's Deep-Space Disaster is the third <a class="text_link" href="https://teammatehunt.com/" target="blank">Teammate Hunt</a>, an online puzzlehunt organized by the group teammate. It contains around fifty puzzles, including unusual crosswords, logic puzzles, and interactive games, and it was designed for teams of four to eight people. In the week it was active, 147 teams reached an ending and 603 teams solved at least one puzzle. The hunt's story features our recurring characters, twins Matt and Emma, this time on board a malfunctioning spaceship. The puzzles are embedded in a comic that expands to tell the twins' story depending on the solvers' choices. <span class="puzzlehunt"><span class="italic">Mouse over to reveal spoilers: </span> <span class="spoiler">the twins will always die on the first attempt, but they are revealed to have time travel capabilities. Teams must reset to the beginning of the story several times and explore possible decisions in order to gather the info necessary to complete all the puzzles</span>.</span> For now, puzzles in Deep-Space Disaster are only accessible to logged-in teams who have unlocked them. I encourage you to <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/register" class="text_link" target="_blank">register a team</a> if you're interested in playing through the hunt.

    This puzzlehunt was created over one year by about thirty-five members of teammate. I pitched the idea and served on the hunt's executive board as Creative Lead. In this role I managed the hunt's art and story, including integrating the puzzle structure with the plot, designing many parts of the website and comic, and organizing work for the art team (about six people). I also co-wrote five puzzles in the hunt — <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/stock-pile" class="text_link" target="_blank">Stock→Pile</a>, <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/pangrams" class="text_link" target="_blank">Pangrams</a>, <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/paingram" class="text_link" target="_blank">Paingram</a>, <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/built-to-spec" class="text_link" target="_blank">Built to Spec</a>, and <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/plot-a-course" class="text_link" target="_blank">Plot a Course</a> — and edited many more. Lots of behind-the-scenes details can be found in the hunt's <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com/wrapup" class="text_link" target="_blank">wrap-up post</a>.

    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/deepspace_disaster2.png">Portions of two puzzles I co-wrote for the hunt. On the left is Pangrams, a simple wordplay puzzle about finding silly phrases to answer clues. On the right is Plot a Course, an advanced interactive metapuzzle where solvers must find a safe path through a 3D maze using information they've learned about each area's hazards.</div><br>
    <div class="big image_box"><img src="data/projects/deepspace_disaster3.png">As the hunt's Creative Lead, I storyboarded about half of the comic (example on the left). These storyboards were used for playtesting the hunt, and informed the final comic art. This part of the comic, drawn by Olga Vinogradova and Jasmine Wang, includes the first decision that teams must make, affecting what puzzles they get next.</div><br>
