    <div class="description">Genesong (a portmanteau of ``Genesis'' and ``Song'') is an infinite series of generative songbooks. Each time the code is run, thirty new songs are created, each one with a random key, chord progression, and rhyme scheme. The specific notes, rhythms, lyrics, and other details are also randomized within those constraints. These songs are then automatically arranged and formatted into a book, ready for printing. The music Genesong writes isn't very sophisticated, but it leaves room for performers to add their own human touch.</div><br>

	<div class="description">Genesong was my submission for a <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/148" class="text_link" target="_blank">2016 NaNoGenMo generative book assignment</a> in the course <a href="http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactivity and Computation</a>, taught by Professor Golan Levin. Its uses <a href="https://rednoise.org/rita/" class="text_link" target="_blank">RiTa</a> for random word generation. More details about the song generation process can be found in <a href="http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/jaqaur/10/27/jaqaur-book/" class="text_link" target="_blank">this blog post about the project</a>. In 2019, I worked with Cameron Sullenberger (arrangement, accompaniment, vocals), Stephanie Goff (vocals), and Joe Coffey (sound engineering) to record three of Genesong's songs in different styles. This work was supported in part by funding from the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/frfaf-overview" class="text_link" target="_blank">Frank-Ratchye Fund For Art @ the Frontier</a>.</div>

The first page contains the three verses, and the second page contains the chorus. In addition to notes, guitar chords are displayed above the staff. The lyrics, while rhyming, are complete gibberish.</div>
