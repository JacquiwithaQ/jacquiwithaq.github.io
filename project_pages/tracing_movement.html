    <div class="subtitle">Watercolor paintings that trace the paths of a person's limbs through different physical activities.</div>
    <div class="description">Tracing Movement is a computational art project that turns motion capture data into watercolor paintings. First a person performs a short action while the locations of their body parts are recorded (as BVH data). Then a robot uses a paintbrush to retrace the positions of their wrists and ankles, with a different color for each limb. The result is an abstract painting that shows the general flow of the recorded motion without actually depicitng a human at all. I created a short series of paintings this way, representing movements from martial arts, gymnastics, and ballet dance.</div><br>

    <div class="description">This project was made for the course <a href="http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Interactivity and Computation</a>, taught by Professor Golan Levin. It uses motion capture performances from Katia Villevald, Max Mirho, Sheela Hanagal, Wynne Yao, and Aria Paradkar. The mocap data was collected using a Microsoft Kinect and <a href="https://brekel.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Brekel</a>, and it was painted by an <a href="https://axidraw.com/" class="text_link" target="_blank">AxiDraw</a>. This work was inspired by <a href="https://objetconnecte.net/chaussons-danse-connectes-e-traces/" class="text_link" target="_blank">Lésia Trubat's Traces</a>.
